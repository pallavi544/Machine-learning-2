# Machine-learning-2
## About the Project
This project focuses on implementing a regression model using supervised learning techniques to predict continuous values based on a given dataset. It covers the complete machine learning pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation and visualization. The notebook is designed to help beginners understand how regression algorithms work in practice.

## Objectives
* Understand and implement a regression algorithm

* Perform data preprocessing such as handling missing values and feature scaling

* Train and test a machine learning model using real-world data

* Evaluate the model using appropriate performance metrics

* Visualize relationships and model accuracy for better interpretation

## Steps Covered
* Data Exploration and Cleaning

* Handling null values

* Feature selection and transformation

* Preprocessing

* Label encoding (if applicable)

* Normalization / Standardization of data

* Model Building

* Training a regression model (e.g., Linear Regression)

* Splitting dataset into training and testing sets

* Model Evaluation

* Mean Squared Error (MSE)

* R-squared (R²) score

* Actual vs. Predicted plot for visual validation

## Technologies Used
* Python – Programming language

* Pandas – Data analysis and manipulation

* NumPy – Numerical computing

* Scikit-learn (sklearn) – Machine learning models and tools

* Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

* Jupyter Notebook – Interactive coding and analysis platform
